# Pyweek30
## Temporary title: Lonely Timmy

For this pyweek 30 the focus will be on "castaway". The majority of the idea will be based on an idle clicker game

The goal will be to escape the island, by building a raft. However, you might not have enough ressources to get away from the island all the way back to Canada.

Why canada you may ask? Well I just finished reading Life of Pi, and well the distination is the same.



# Diary

## Day 1: 
I was actually not really ready for this day. So the majority of the day was spent on brainstorming ideas. I ended up on a cookie clicker version.

## Day 2:
For this day the focus was on getting the base game up and running.
